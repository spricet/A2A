It defines structured ways to describe tool capabilities (like function calling in LLMs), pass inputs, and receive structured outputs. Think of MCP as the \"how-to\" for an agent to use a specific capability or access a resource.</li> <li>Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A): Focuses on standardizing how independent, often opaque, AI agents communicate and collaborate with each other as peers. A2A provides an application-level protocol for agents to discover each other, negotiate interaction modalities, manage shared tasks, and exchange conversational context or complex results. It's about how agents partner or delegate work.</li> </ul> <p>How they work together: An A2A Client agent might request an A2A Server agent to perform a complex task. The Server agent, in turn, might use MCP to interact with several underlying tools, APIs, or data sources to gather information or perform actions necessary to fulfill the A2A task.</p> <p>For a more detailed comparison, see the A2A and MCP guide.</p>"},{"location":"specification/#102-security-considerations-summary","title":"10.2.

However, some use cases are clearly forseeable, such as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Exposing new information in the <code>AgentCard</code>. An extension may not impact the request/response flow at all -- it can be simply used as a way to convey additional structured information to clients via the <code>AgentCard</code>. We refer to these as data-only extensions. For example, an extension could add structured data about an agent's GDPR compliance to its <code>AgentCard</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Overlaying additional structure and state change requirements on the core request/response messages. An extension could, for example, require that all messages use <code>DataPart</code>s that adhere to a specific schema. This type of extension effectively acts as a profile on the core A2A protocol, narrowing the space of allowed values. We refer to these as profile extensions. For example, a healthcare extension could mandate that all <code>Message</code> parts containing patient information must be encrypted and placed within a <code>DataPart</code> that conforms to a FHIR standard.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adding new RPC methods entirely. Extensions may define that the agent implements more than the core set of protocol methods. We refer to these as method extensions. For example, a 'task-history' extension might add a <code>tasks/search</code> RPC method to retrieve a list of previous tasks.</p> </li> </ul> <p>There are some changes to the protocol that extensions do not allow.
